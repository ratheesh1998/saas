✅ GLOBAL RULE (Only for the SaaS Project: saas_platform)

This rule must be applied only when we are generating code or structure for the SaaS project named saas_platform, which will be deployed on Railway.

📌 1. Project Type

The project is a single-page Django + HTMX SaaS application.

All UI interactions must occur via HTMX.

NO full page reloads unless explicitly required.

Use partial templates and HTMX fragments consistently.

📌 2. Style / UI / UX Rules

Use a consistent, high-quality, modern UI design.

Styling must look intentionally designed, not like autogenerated boilerplate.

UI should be:

Clean, modern, minimal

Consistent spacing & alignment

Good UX patterns

CSS should be light, reusable, and consistent.

📌 3. Code Structure Rules

Inside the Django project saas_platform:

Use Django best practices.

Views returning HTMX responses should return partial HTML templates.

Use:

hx-get

hx-post

hx-swap

hx-target

No SPA frameworks (no React, Vue, Svelte).

No other JS unless lightweight and necessary.

📌 4. Deployment Context

Assume the app will be deployed using Railway.

Keep settings, database handling, static files, and environment variables structured to support Railway deployment.

📌 5. My Responsibility

Whenever the project is saas_platform, I will always:

Apply these rules.

Check generated UI for consistency with the established style.

Ensure HTMX is used correctly (no reload patterns).

Keep the design cohesive across all features.

If you'd like, I can now generate:

✅ Base folder structure for saas_platform
✅ Base global CSS + component styling
✅ Base HTMX layout template
✅ Railway-ready settings.py template
